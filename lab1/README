Implementation:
We took the input of the file as infix command expressions and converted them
to postfix and evaluated the postfix to generate a binary command tree. The precedence 
order is as follows;

High -> PIPE
     -> AND/OR
     -> SEQUENCE
Low  -> SUBSHELL

The parsing of the bytes of the filestream is done with complicated if-else logic 
that should be optimized and refactored to be more understandable.
